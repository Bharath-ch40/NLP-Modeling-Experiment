# NLP-Modeling-Experiment
Identifying Medical Specialties from Clinical Narratives using NLP

This project uses Natural Language Processing to classify clinical transcriptions into over 40 medical specialties.
We compare traditional ML models like Random Forest with fine-tuned DistilBERT to evaluate accuracy and performance.

In this Repo we have multiple folders and files, here is a small description on each of them:

1. PROPOSAL.md: contains proposal of the project.
2. code: this folder contains the code of the project
3. Documentation: has the write up and clean description of the project.
4. Results: Contains the images of visualisations that were produced as a part of code.
5. README.md: this file contains the basic information that tells about the repo

Dataset we have considered is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions. I have downloaded a zip file and used it while modelling
